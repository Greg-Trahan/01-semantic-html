## Description
The goal of this assignment is to add semantic tags to the HTML file to improve the clarity of the code.

## Usage
This file could be used by the Horiseon group to advertize their services.

## What I did
I replaced many of the standard div tags in the HTML file with more descriptive semantic tags to improve clarity in the code, as well as added comments to help navigate the code. I fixed the "Search Engine Optimization" link in the navigation bar, and made some adjustments to the CSS file to consolidate repetitive code while ensuring no change in the final layout of the webpage.

## What I learned
I learned more about some of the semantic tags that can be used when coding in HTML, as well as how CSS can be linked to an HTML file to give it structure.
